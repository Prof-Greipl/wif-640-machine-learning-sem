# Overview

The module is diving into the concepts and algorithms behind machine learning.  The module is structured by colab notebooks, that can be found in the folder ```colab_notebooks```. 



##### Syllabus

The contents is structured in three blocks. In **Block A** you will get introduced to  the tools we neeed to load, analyze and change data sets. In **Block B**, the main block, we will analyse the implementation of a simple neural network in Phython. All the code is available, so you will not need to do lots of programming - but you need to understand the code. Finally we will have a look into Keras in **Block C**
