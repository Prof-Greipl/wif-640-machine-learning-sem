#### Syllabus


The module is structured in three blocks. In **Block A** you will get introduced to  the tools we need to load, analyze, visualize and prepare data sets. In **Block B**, the main block, we will analyse the implementation of a simple neural network in Phython. All the code is available, so you will not need to do lots of programming - but you need to understand the code. Finally we will dive into some use cases in **Block C**
