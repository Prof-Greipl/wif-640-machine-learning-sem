# Literature and Links for WIF 640

This document outlines the most important tools we use in the course. Make sure, that you dive into all sources notes as mandatory. Other sources might only be relevant for participants working on their individual assignment on the topic.

## Languages and Tools 
---
### Colab

- [C1] https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI (mandatory)

### Phython

- [P1] https://www.w3schools.com/python/ 
A simple introduction to Phython. Your first choice to understand, how things work, but limited in scope

- [P2] https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
The complete reference. We need only a limited number of language elements. mostly in chapters 7. and 8. 

### Numpy
- [N1] https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html
The use Numpy to manage matrices and vectors. Focus on https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.creation.html and https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.rec.html

### Pandas
Pandas is a data analysis toolkit to be used in Phython. It is wide used to analyse and prepare source data.

- [P1] https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html (mandatory)


### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures. We use it to visualize data, training processes and model quality.

- [MP] https://matplotlib.org/


### Keras
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python. It allows us to quickly develop ML models.

- [FRA] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMcjV8xwapk (mandatory)
Watch this, to understand the key terminology. Part of the Google ML crash course.

- [NIE] http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/about.html
A excellent on-line book by Michael Nielsen. I will exactly define the mandatory contents in the course. The most relevant chapter is http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html 

- [3B1] https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk (mandatory)
You *must* watch this before diving into the course. It serves as a background of the whole course.

- [SMO] https://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf
*Introduction to Machine Learning* by Alex Smola. Very good in highlighting the mathematical background.

- [GML] https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
A brilliant high-level source to dive into ML.
