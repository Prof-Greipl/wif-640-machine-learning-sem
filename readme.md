# WIF 640 Einführung in Maschinelles Lernen

[Hochschule für angewandt Wissenschaften Landshut](http://haw-landshut.de)

Instructor: Prof. Dr. Dieter Greipl

#### Overview

The module is diving into the concepts and algorithms behind machine learning, especially deep learning.  It is designed as an introduction course, so no prior knowlede in ML is needed.

If you want to get a quite detailed overview some selected contents, watch this great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=246s) of the 3BLUE1BROWNSERIES. 

The module is structured in three blocks. In **Block A** you will get introduced to  tools we need to load, analyze, visualize and prepare data sets. In **Block B**, the main block, we will analyse the implementation of a simple neural network in Phython. All the code is available, so you will not need to do lots of programming - but you need to understand the code. Finally we will dive into some use cases in **Block C**
